## Hello World!

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Mike Abramo, an aspiring blockchain developer from Boston.

Living in the city where the American Revolution started, I am forever motivated by the revolutionary spirit of self-sovereignty that shapes this nation. As an aspiring blockchain developer, I believe that open public blockchains possess the potential to revolutionize society by reducing centralized power structures.

My passion for blockchain technology drives my commitment to building a brighter future for our communities. I am dedicated to promoting financial autonomy and guaranteeing equal access to financial services for all, empowering each person to pursue their unique vision of the American Dream.

Let's build together to advance blockchain technology and reshape the world with a more distributed vision, where each individual has power over their future. Blockchain is about empowering people, not controlling them. I'd love to help make this value a reality!

That is all for now. If you are interested in saying hello or following my progress, feel free to follow me on my [Github](https://github.com/SonnyMonroe) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SonnyTheDegen)!

Onwards!

-Mike Abramo
